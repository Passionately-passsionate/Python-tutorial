# Python-tutorial
Python tutorial trial and practice code lines.


The file contains the lines of codes I wrote to practice/ test its working. I have followed Corey Schafer's Python tutorial for beginners on youtube. I may remove this repository in future, however at this moment as I'm learning I'm excited to post my first code file onto Github which is also a trial on creating repository.
